Tarball Install Tools

The software provided consists of

head.pl           -- script to customize with your code 
MakeChanges.pm    -- perl module enabling regex based changes to 
                        files of your choice 
install.pl        -- example finished install script (which 
                        installs the above files)

The first task is to create a tarball of the software or files you 
wish to distribute to other hosts and customize, typically 

tar -czvf <name of your file>.tar <file or directories to include>

or, if you don't have gnu tar:

tar -cvf <name of your file>.tar <file or directories to include>
gzip <name of your file>.tar

There are two possible things you will need to change in head.pl after
creating your tarball: 1) the location of the perl on your systems. Make
sure the shebang line is correct:

#!/usr/bin/perl

should be changed to reflect the location of the perl executable on your
system. You can determine this by executing

which perl

at the shell prompt.

2) insert any customization script after the

# your script goes here

line and before the __DATA__ line. You have the full power of perl at your
command. What's that you say? Writing all that custom script is more
than you want to take on? Say no more, the solution is at hand. This is
what the MakeChanges.pm module is all about. It allows you to simply
supply the names of the files you want to modify with one or more perl
regular expressions you wish to apply to them. You can also automatically
make backups of the original files prior to applying those changes. In
addition, you can have the program prompt for your approval prior to
making each change with a diff of the proposed change to be made.

If you don't wish to use MakeChanges.pm, skip down to the section,

If you don't wish to use MakeChanges.pm, skip down to the section,
"Assembling the Installation Script."

This module does have a couple prerequisites. These will need to be
installed on your systems before you can use MakeChanges.pm:

Config::Std Text::Diff

which can be downloaded and installed from http://www.cpan.org.

You will also need to put MakeChanges.pm on each system you wish to use
it on.  You can either put it in a directory already in your perl @INC,
which you can see with the following command:

perl -e 'for (@INC) {print "$_\n"}'

or you can install it in any place of your choosing, and then include
a line in head.pl to tell it where to find it:

use lib '/path/to/your/MakeChanges.pm';

In either case, you'll need to include the line

use MakeChanges;

in head.pl.


Assembling the Installation Script

Once you have your tarball created and your head.pl scripting done, you
can assemble them into a single executable with the following commands:

cat head.pl <your_tar_ball>.tar.gz > install.pl chmod 744 install.pl

where you need to substitute the name of your tar file for
<your_tar_ball>.tar.gz.  You can now distribute the file to your other
systems, execute it, and your customized software will be installed.

Note that once the install script has been created, editing it will 
cause the tarball portion of the file to become corrupted so that it 
will not be possible to extract it. So make all your changes before 
assembling the installation script.

I hope you find this useful. If you do, or if you have any criticisms, 
comments or suggested improvements, please drop me a note at
