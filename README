Tarball Install Tools

These perl scripts are tools for installing files from a tarball on *NIX
based systems. The idea is to have a single, self-installing executable
that can be passed to multiple hosts which will extract the necessary
files and customize them for the specific host system.

This can be of particular use when you're installing software on
multiple *NIX hosts, and the installer for that software is lengthy,
tedious, and/or requires manual customization. In these cases, doing the
installation once, then making a tarball of the finished installation
can be a great time saver.
